## üîç Overview
This script prompts the user to enter an email address and then performs several checks to determine whether the email is valid according to a specific set of rules. If the email passes all checks, a confirmation message is displayed.

---

## ‚úÖ Validation Rules
The email is considered valid only if it meets the following conditions:

1. Must be at least 6 characters long.
2. First character must be an alphabet.
3. Must contain exactly one `@` symbol.
4. Must contain either `.com` or `.in` at the end.
5. Should not contain any spaces.
6. Should not contain uppercase letters.
7. Only the following special characters are allowed: `_`, `.`, `@`

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
The script performs step-by-step checks using conditional statements and loops. It tracks three flags:

- `k`: Set if space is found.
- `j`: Set if an uppercase alphabet is found.
- `d`: Set if any disallowed special character is found.

If any of these flags are raised, the email is considered invalid.

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage
Run the Python script and enter your email when prompted:

```bash
python email_validator.py
```

Example:
```
 Enter your Email : swapnilbilgoji@gmail.com
 YOUR__EMAIL__IS__CORRECT 

 THANK__YOU__FOR__ENTERING__YOUR__EMAIL
```

## üí° Sample Output

```

### ‚ùå Invalid Email:

```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations
- This is a basic validator and may not cover all edge cases as per RFC 5322 (email standard).
- Does not support emails with subdomains (e.g., name@mail.co.in).
- No GUI, CLI-based only.
